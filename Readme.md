# LeetLab

Leetlab is a Leetcode-inspired application that leverages the Judge0 API to enable users to execute code directly on the platform. This project follows the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and integrates third-party services to replicate key functionalities of Leetcode.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts, which are authenticated and stored in the Prisma database. Account creation supports both admin and user roles.
- **Problem Solving**: Authenticated users can access multiple coding challenges to refine their problem-solving skills. Admins have the ability to create and manage Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems.
- **Code Execution**: Users can submit their code for execution via the Judge0 engine, which processes the code in the specified language. Execution resultsâ€”whether incorrect or successfulâ€”are stored in the Prisma database and displayed to the users.
